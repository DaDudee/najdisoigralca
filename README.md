# najdisoigralca
A group project from the first year of college â€” a basic web app for organizing athletes, matches, and competitions. Built with Node.js (Express APIs), JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Knex.js for database access. Runs in Docker: one container for the Node frontend/backend, and another for MySQL/MariaDB. Hosted on my own TrueNAS server, via my domain.
